##(Interactive Bin Monsters)

IBMs are bins that want to be your friend. But they're hungry. No, they're *really* hungry! And they need your help. Feed them with rubbish and they will show their appreciation.

The IBMs (Interactive Bin Monsters) were created during [Codethecity Edinburgh](http://codethecity.org/hacks/uk/edinburgh/2015-06-codethecity-edinburgh/) over the weekend of 20th and 21st June 2015. Codethecity is hackathon, an opportunity for designers, coders and artists to come together for a weekend and create something wonderful. The theme of the Codethecity event was *The Environment*. The team of hardware makers were [Dave Morrison](http://github.com/davemor), [Kuro-Kuris](https://github.com/kuro-kuris) and [Iain Robinson](http://github.com/itrobinson).

Here you can read about how we created the IBMs, find out what hardware we used and download the software we wrote.

##The idea##
Bins are boring. But not these bins! We wanted to make a bin that talks to you every time you feed it.

The bin has a sensor inside that detects when the bin is opened and rubbish is thrown in. A beam of light inside the bin is broken momentarily whenever rubbish is dropped. A sensor detects the rubbish and plays a pre-recorded sound. The voices of the bin were provided by contributers at the *Codethecity* hackathon.
